          <h2>Beginning</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">Pizza is an Indian pizza (delivery-only) brand, incorporated in 2017. It takes online orders through its app and website. Mojo Pizza claims to serve double toppings on their pizzas.
          Mojo Pizza was founded by Anshul Gupta and Amit Raj, who own BOX8 Anshul from IIT Bombay was previously an analyst at Deutsche Bank, and Amit from IIT Kharagpur worked as a senior analyst for Deutsche Bank. 
          </p>
          
          <h2>Aim</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">Mojo Pizza was to reach not only a maximum number of people but also reach the right people, at the right time, and with the right message.
          The entire plan was curated by keeping an “Effective Reach and an optimum level of frequency” in mind. This effective reach when coupled with an optimum frequency of the brand aimed to deliver something that the Brand Mojo Pizza has been chasing – Building Awareness in the minds of potential consumers along with an opportunity to get some quality conversions as a bonus. The team at ET Medialabs landed onto a strategy that not only addressed the immediate objective but also served as an answer to what’s next after increased awareness.
          Mojo Pizza has grown to INR 100 CR revenue brand. The first half of this year would be an aberration owing to covid, but the duo is confident of 100% year-on-year growth as things start getting back to normal.

          <h2>Business Model</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">Owners of cloud-kitchen brand Box8 and MOJO Pizza has raised $40 million in a round led by Tiger Global.
          Founded by two IIT graduates Amit Raj and Anshul Gupta, EatClub Brands started out with BOX8, known for its All-in-1 Meals & Desi Box.  It currently owns 8 brands that operate out of its 150+ kitchens.
          It also runs GLOBO Ice Cream and ZAZA Biryani.
          "EatClub Brands is re-imagining how kitchens can operate through its innovative tech-first, full-stack cloud kitchen model. We are impressed with the company's ability to achieve scale and customer loyalty, first with BOX8 and then with MOJO Pizza, while achieving impressive unit economics, and we are excited to partner with them as they continue to grow," said Griffin Schroeder, Partner, Tiger Global.
          They are present across 5 cities in India- Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, NCR and Hyderabad - delivering over 1.5 million meals every month.
          "We have deliberately spent time in building deep capabilities in food, technology & operations. With this additional funding, we now plan to rapidly scale geographically to 500+ kitchens in 15 cities. We are planning to aggressively on-board talent and build robust teams- the backbone of our organisation," said Amit Raj, Co-Founder, EatClub Brands (formerly BOX8).
          
          <h2>Revenue Stream</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">Mojo Pizza has grown to INR 100 CR revenue brand. The first half of this year would be an aberration owing to covid, but the duo is confident for a 100% year on year growth as things start getting back to normal.
          
          <h2>Marketing</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">Mojo has several claims to fame, according to Gupta, and one is that it offers double the toppings of other pizza brands.
          
          "Before we started MOJO Pizza, we noticed that all other pizzas available in the market had very few toppings," he said "We realized how consumers were being deprived of the ideal experience, so we decided to fill in the gap by ensuring double the amount of toppings on our pizzas."
          
          Offering an efficient delivery experience is also key.
          
          "Ninety-eight percent of our orders are delivered in less than 30 minutes," Gupta said. "We ensure that every delivery executive is provided complete training and SOPs on technology, app usage, communication skills, problem handling, safe riding, zero contact delivery, etc."
          
          The fair price point has also helped Mojo thrive.
          
          A 10-inch pizza, which serves two, starts around $7, and the average order is under $8.
          
          "Customers can take a SlashPass membership from our app and (receive) 30% off, plus free delivery on every order," Gupta said.
          
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">Pizza eaters all over the country were tired of dealing with the ‘lack of toppings’ in a Pizza. Mojo Pizza solved this very problem by introducing its pizza with 2X Toppings. However, the crucial thing for the brand was to reach the relevant audience by building awareness for both the brand and its offering.
          
          Mojo Pizza introduced the campaign #MoveOnToMojoPizza with Yami Gautam promoting its ‘2x toppings’ offering.
          
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">One big piece of the objective puzzle for Mojo Pizza was to reach not only maximum people but also reaching the right people, at the right time, and with the right messaging.
          
          The entire plan was curated by keeping an “Effective Reach and an optimum level of frequency” in mind. This effective reach when coupled with an optimum frequency of the brand aimed to deliver something that the Brand Mojo Pizza has been chasing – Building Awareness in the minds of Potential consumers along with an opportunity to get some quality conversions as bonus.
          
          In essence the objective:
          
          Effective Reach + Optimum Frequency = Brand Space in the minds of Consumers
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          
          <p id="p1">By marketing to today’s sophisticated youth in a multi-channel manner, Mojo Pizza witnessed a whopping 23% increase in Brand impressions to the last quarter(April-June).There was a 14% increase in clicks while the brand managed to keep its CTR intact despite there being a massive increase in the search volume. UAC video only campaigns performed well and its conversions & reach metrics were good.
