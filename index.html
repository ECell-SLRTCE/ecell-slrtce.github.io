                            <a href="#" class="blog-title">Importance of Entrepreneurship</a>
                            <p>"[1] The benefits of entrepreneurship extend beyond the businesses they establish. Entrepreneurs improve the lives of individuals and communities, as well as the overall economy. Entrepreneurs have been instrumental in spurring social change and improving the way people live and work.
        
                                [2] There are many reasons to consider entrepreneurship, from its freedom and flexibility to the job satisfaction it can offer.
                                i. Be your own boss. ...
                                ii. Potentially unlimited income.
                                iii. Choose when and where you work.
                                iv. Make a living doing what you love.
                                v. Constant growth and development.
                                vi. Choose who you work with.
                                vii. Create a positive impact.
                                
                                [3] Entrepreneurship Accelerates Economic Growth by creating new jobs and opportunities.
                                
                                [4] It also promotes innovation solving problems that existing products and technology have not yet solved.
                                
                                [5] Leads to better standards of living as entrepreneurs.
                                
                                [6] It also supports research and development.
                                Before introducing a new product or service in the market, an in-depth investigation and testing of the product is typically necessary. As a result, an entrepreneur works with research organisations and institutions and provides funding for research and development. This often helps boost research and development, which may make discoveries possible."</p>

                            <a href="#" class="blog-title">MOJO PIZZA</a>
                            <p>"Mojo Pizza is an Indian pizza (delivery-only) brand, incorporated in 2017. It takes online orders through its app and website. It claims to serve double toppings on their pizzas. 
        
                                Beginning
                                
                                Mojo Pizza is an Indian pizza (delivery-only) brand, incorporated in 2017. It takes online orders through its app and website. Mojo Pizza claims to serve double toppings on their pizzas.
                                Mojo Pizza was founded by Anshul Gupta and Amit Raj, who own BOX8 Anshul from IIT Bombay was previously an analyst at Deutsche Bank, and Amit from IIT Kharagpur worked as a senior analyst for Deutsche Bank.
                                
                                Aim
                                
                                Mojo Pizza was to reach not only a maximum number of people but also reach the right people, at the right time, and with the right message.
                                The entire plan was curated by keeping an “Effective Reach and an optimum level of frequency” in mind. This effective reach when coupled with an optimum frequency of the brand aimed to deliver something that the Brand Mojo Pizza has been chasing – Building Awareness in the minds of potential consumers along with an opportunity to get some quality conversions as a bonus. The team at ET Medialabs landed onto a strategy that not only addressed the immediate objective but also served as an answer to what’s next after increased awareness.
                                Mojo Pizza has grown to INR 100 CR revenue brand. The first half of this year would be an aberration owing to covid, but the duo is confident of 100% year-on-year growth as things start getting back to normal.
                                
                                Business Model
                                
                                Owners of cloud-kitchen brand Box8 and MOJO Pizza has raised $40 million in a round led by Tiger Global.
                                Founded by two IIT graduates Amit Raj and Anshul Gupta, EatClub Brands started out with BOX8, known for its All-in-1 Meals & Desi Box.  It currently owns 8 brands that operate out of its 150+ kitchens.
                                It also runs GLOBO Ice Cream and ZAZA Biryani.
                                "EatClub Brands is re-imagining how kitchens can operate through its innovative tech-first, full-stack cloud kitchen model. We are impressed with the company's ability to achieve scale and customer loyalty, first with BOX8 and then with MOJO Pizza, while achieving impressive unit economics, and we are excited to partner with them as they continue to grow," said Griffin Schroeder, Partner, Tiger Global.
                                They are present across 5 cities in India- Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, NCR and Hyderabad - delivering over 1.5 million meals every month.
                                "We have deliberately spent time in building deep capabilities in food, technology & operations. With this additional funding, we now plan to rapidly scale geographically to 500+ kitchens in 15 cities. We are planning to aggressively on-board talent and build robust teams- the backbone of our organisation," said Amit Raj, Co-Founder, EatClub Brands (formerly BOX8).

                                Mojo Pizza has grown to INR 100 CR revenue brand. The first half of this year would be an aberration owing to covid, but the duo is confident for a 100% year on year growth as things start getting back to normal.

                                Mojo has several claims to fame, according to Gupta, and one is that it offers double the toppings of other pizza brands.
                                
                                "Before we started MOJO Pizza, we noticed that all other pizzas available in the market had very few toppings," he said "We realized how consumers were being deprived of the ideal experience, so we decided to fill in the gap by ensuring double the amount of toppings on our pizzas."
                                
                                Offering an efficient delivery experience is also key.
                                
                                "Ninety-eight percent of our orders are delivered in less than 30 minutes," Gupta said. "We ensure that every delivery executive is provided complete training and SOPs on technology, app usage, communication skills, problem handling, safe riding, zero contact delivery, etc."
                                
                                The fair price point has also helped Mojo thrive.
                                
                                A 10-inch pizza, which serves two, starts around $7, and the average order is under $8.
                                
                                "Customers can take a SlashPass membership from our app and (receive) 30% off, plus free delivery on every order," Gupta said.
                                
                                Challenges
                                
                                Pizza eaters all over the country were tired of dealing with the ‘lack of toppings’ in a Pizza. Mojo Pizza solved this very problem by introducing its pizza with 2X Toppings. However, the crucial thing for the brand was to reach the relevant audience by building awareness for both the brand and its offering.
                                
                                Mojo Pizza introduced the campaign #MoveOnToMojoPizza with Yami Gautam promoting its ‘2x toppings’ offering.
                                
                                Objectives
                                
                                One big piece of the objective puzzle for Mojo Pizza was to reach not only maximum people but also reaching the right people, at the right time, and with the right messaging.
                                
                                The entire plan was curated by keeping an “Effective Reach and an optimum level of frequency” in mind. This effective reach when coupled with an optimum frequency of the brand aimed to deliver something that the Brand Mojo Pizza has been chasing – Building Awareness in the minds of Potential consumers along with an opportunity to get some quality conversions as bonus.
                                
                                In essence the objective:
                                
                                Effective Reach + Optimum Frequency = Brand Space in the minds of Consumers
                                
                                Conclusion
                                
                                By marketing to today’s sophisticated youth in a multi-channel manner, Mojo Pizza witnessed a whopping 23% increase in Brand impressions to the last quarter(April-June).There was a 14% increase in clicks while the brand managed to keep its CTR intact despite there being a massive increase in the search volume. UAC video only campaigns performed well and its conversions & reach metrics were good."</p>

                            <p>"For a long time, paying the bills of credit cards wasn’t something that we enjoyed and looked forward to do so. But with the launch of CRED, even this process has become ‘fun’ for the working professionals.
        
                                If you use this fintech platform to pay your card bills you can simply earn CRED coins and get exclusive member deals across various in-app offerings. What makes this app more interesting is that, once you have collected enough such coins you can even check out the CRED store to find a range of products from curated brands.
                                
                                In this blog, we will present you a brief analysis of CRED’s journey so far.
                                
                                To begin with, let’s understand what kind of a platform CRED is.
                                
                                What is CRED?
                                
                                CRED is a Bangalore-based startup which allows the credit card users to pay their card bills through this platform and also earn reward points for each transaction. This fintech platform also helps the users to make their house rent payments. Moreover, the company assures you the complete protection of all your data and information, which makes it fully safe and secure to use.
                                
                                How did it begin?
                                
                                Well, the idea behind launching CRED was quite clear. Its founder Kunal Shah wanted to create a platform which can make young generation’s life more systematic in terms of managing finance.
                                
                                He wanted to offer more privileges and benefits for the people having good credit scores and so creating a flywheel effect for them was important to improve the scores. As far as the target audience was concerned, Kunal decided to focus specifically on those people who pay their taxes on time just like a responsible citizen of the country.
                                
                                So, what motivated Kunal to launch CRED in India? Well, after Kunal Shah’s first venture, FreeCharge, was sold to Snapdeal in 2015, he spent a lot of time in traveling and exploring new things about several developed nations. One common point, which he actually noticed while learning about such countries, there was a high degree of trust extended by the system upon the public. For an instance, they had petrol pumps without any attendant, or self-checkout counters in the supermarkets. That’s how Kunal understood the importance of frictionless environment, which means an environment where all the costs and restraints related to the transactions are non-existent.
                                
                                In this way, eliminating the scope of confusion and errors, Kunal Shah established a trustworthy platform for public, CRED, in 2018.
                                
                                About Kunal Shah
                                
                                Born in 1983, Kunal graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from Wilson College, Mumbai and later pursued MBA from the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) before dropping out. The Mumbai-born businessman started his entrepreneurial journey with PaisaBack, a cashback and promotional platform for the retailers. However, he soon exited that venture to establish a new company, FreeCharge, with his partner Sandeep Tandon in August 2010.
                                
                                In 2015, when Snapdeal acquired FreeCharge, Kunal decided to launch another start-up CRED in 2018. 
                                
                                Growth of CRED in the market
                                
                                From beginning just as a credit card bill payment app to becoming a giant player in the e-commerce business and in the investment sector as well, CRED has certainly achieved a lot in the past two years. Despite growing with such a pace in the market, the fintech platform is still focusing on expanding its users rather than making profits. The company has raised over $800 million till date.
                                
                                Furthermore, CRED saw a great hike in its popularity during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020. The company reported an increase in both its user base and the fundings when it signed a three-year deal with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as an official partner for the cash-rich league.
                                
                                On the top of that, as of October 2020, CRED had 30 lakh customers and 20% of them were premium credit card holders.
                                
                                Earlier this year, CRED became the latest homegrown company to enter the unicorn club with a Series D funding of $215 million by new investor Falcon Edge Capital and existing investor Coatue Management.
                                
                                Reason behind CRED’s success
                                
                                If you are still thinking that how CRED has managed to gain success in such a short period of time? The answer lies in its huge engagement. Most importantly, CRED keeps offering interesting products to its users. Options like UPI payments, which can be used to make all forms of transactions, rent payments and credit card bill payments are what propelling the continuous growth of this platform from the last couple of years. Any working professional can come to Cred and get all his basic needs fulfilled."</p>
